Face Recognition System 👁️‍🗨️

A deep learning–based Face Recognition System built using Python and OpenCV. This project detects, encodes, and recognizes human faces in real time or from images with high accuracy. Designed for efficiency, scalability, and modern computer vision workflows.

🚀 Features

Real-time face detection using webcam or uploaded images.

Face encoding and matching with optimized algorithms.

Automatic dataset creation for new faces.

High accuracy with deep learning embeddings.

Clean modular code that’s easy to extend or integrate.

🧠 Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, face_recognition, dlib

Environment: Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)

🧩 How It Works

Detects faces using a CNN-based model.

Converts faces to numerical embeddings.

Compares embeddings with the stored database.

Identifies or labels faces based on similarity threshold.

🛠️ Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/charan10187/FACE-GENDER-DETECTION-using-DL-/tree/main
cd Face-Recognition
pip install -r requirements.txt

▶️ Usage

Open the notebook:

jupyter notebook Face_recognisation.ipynb


Run each cell sequentially to perform detection and recognition.

📈 Future Enhancements

Add GUI using Streamlit or Flask.

Support for video surveillance and attendance tracking.

Cloud-based face data storage.

📸 Example Output

Recognized faces highlighted in real-time video feed with labels.
